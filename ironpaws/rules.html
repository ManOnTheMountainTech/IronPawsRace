                        <li>*Revised for clarity: <b>Iron Paws is a mushing competition.</b> As such, all dogs will run on a gangline attached to
                            a properly fitted pulling harness.
                        </li>
                        <li>Iron Paw Factory manages points only</li>
                        <li> Run your teams at your own risk. Mush responsibly with the best interest of your
                        dogs in mind.  Consult your veterinarian before harnessing any dog under 18 months of age. 
                        Helmets are recommended for all wheeled classes. Play fairly and respectfully.
                        </li>
                        <li> Iron Paw Factory relies on the honor system. Play fair. Be honest</li>
                        <li> Teams can mix and match dogs. You can run any combination of dogs you like up to
                        the maximum number allowable for your class. *updated for clarity:<b> you can drop dogs mid run, but you may
                        not add fresh dogs once you have started recording mileage.</b></li>
                        <li>Only one run per team, per day, can be counted for points.</li>
                        <li>Individual dogs may participate on more than one team, but each dog can only score
                        in one run per day.</li>
                        <li>Each team's lowest score will be dropped.</li>

                        scores will not be accepted</b>.</li>
                        <li> Any and all complaints about fellow competitors must be reported to your Regional Team Leader or one of the Race
                        Marshals in a timely manner for consideration. When planning your strategy and before submitting a complaint, please

                <h6 class="text-center"><b> Race Volunteer </b></h6>
                <p>Iron Paws appreciates and encourages the volunteers that keep our sport going. If you are an official volunteer at a club sanctioned race, you can earn additional points. </p>
                    <ul class="text-left">
                        <li> Earn 5 points per day for volunteering up to 10 points per stage</li>
                        <li> You must be an official volunteer assigned a duty by the race manager. Volunteer positions that qualify include Race Manager, Race Marshal, Chute Boss, Trail Boss, Timer, Spotter, Awards Maker, Sponser Recruiter, and Race Promoter.</li>

                <h6 class="text-center"><b> Regional Team Points </b></h6>
                <p>Ideally, every region will have a team. If you don't live near other participants, don't worry, we'll find a team for you! You can form a team with as few as 5 participants, but to be competitive, you'll need closer to 10. Please note, this year there will be no allowances for sub-regions and smaller regional teams. The allowances created more problems than they solved.</p>
                    <ul class="text-left">
                        <li> Each regional team earns 50 points for hosting a Regional Group Run</li>
                        <li> Each region earns 2 points per Iron Paws participant, and 1 point for any additional participants at their Regional Group Run.</li>
                        <li> The scores of the top five participants in each region are added to that region's team score each stage (minus miles).</li>
                    </ul><br>
                
                <h6 class="text-center"><b> ODR - Old Dogs Rule (and Handi-Cappy) Class </b></h6>
                <p>ODR is for any and all old dogs, dogs coming off an injury, or Handi-Cappy Dogs (<a href="../../www.instagram.com/chases_captain_jack.3.delayed">Cappy</a> is our one-eyed, three-legged mascot). Basically any dog that can't run with the team and would otherwise be left out of the fun is eligible. ODR teams must run at least one mile and post one photo per week as well as complete 6 out of 7 weeks to be a finisher. Any musher participating in a regular class may also participate in this special class for no additional charge. This class is tracked separately and no finishers medals are awarded. In this class ONLY, dogs may participate with a leash attached at the collar. </p>
                
                <h2 class="text-center">A Final Note on Sportsmanship</h2>
                <p>sports·man·ship /ˈspôrtsmənˌSHip/ <br>
                    noun: sportsmanship <br>
                    : fair and generous behavior or treatment of others, especially in a sports contest. <br>
                    : conduct becoming to one participating in a sport such as fairness, respect for one's opponent, and graciousness in winning or losing</p>
                    <ul class="text-left">
                        <li> Iron Paws relies on the honor system. Play fair. Be honest.</li>
                        <li> The biggest tangilble award we offer is the finisher's medal. Compete accordingly.</li>
                        <li> The organizers can and will eject any participant not conducting him or herself in a manner not meeting the above definition of sportsmanship. </li>
                        <li> The organizers are responsible for managing points only. Due to the remote nature of the participants, we are unable to control clashes in personalities or other interpersonal issues that ruin the fun for everyone involved. Please choose to play the game in a manner
                        that is fun for you and your dog and allows others to do the same.</li>
